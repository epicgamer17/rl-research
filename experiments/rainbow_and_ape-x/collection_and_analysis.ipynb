    "    2. We release code for Rainbow that can train X steps in Y minutes on a Mac M2 Chip\n",
    "    3. We also release a version of Ape-X as described in the original paper, and an Ape-X with rainbow\n",

    "        2. Compare Ape-X with different Rainbow components added or removed\n",
    "    4. We compare the different models of DQN as seen in their papers to rainbow, the different individual components to rainbow, and rainbow with individual components removed\n",
    "    5. We graph the convergence of Hyperopt for both tensorflow and torch, we do a score/trials graph and we compare to random hyper parameters \n",
    "    6. We graph the exploration of the Hyperopt algorithm showing the difference between consecutive trials to measure when the algorithm is “confident” in its parameters\n",
